			<p class="text-white">The data includes the two different datasets of HR analytics, where each dataset holds 50k records. The objective of this project is to explore the factors influencing employee retention within the context of the organization. By examining historical employee data, including demographics, job roles, compensation, performance metrics. The insights gained from the analysis will enable organization to make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies to enhance employee retention rates.This project describes a new, emerging way to shed light on a dataset and to communicate the findings with a broad audience. I begin this process with understanding of the data, connect the data to the Power BI tool, perform data modelling and create visualization. In this paper, I describe in detail the process by which i explored the data and built the visualizations that underlie that work.</p>
