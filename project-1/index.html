			<p class="text-white">The project describes a new, emerging way to shed light on a Stakeholders dataset and to communicate the findings with a broad audience. I begin this process with understanding of the data followed by KPI creation, data modelling, data cleaning and embed them within a narrative using infographics. I have created this end-to-end project in Microsoft Excel. I illustrate the concepts of a business to help sales team to summarize what happened and know where the strong and weak products and sales areas.  In this paper, i have described in detail the process by which i explored the data and built the visualizations that underlie that work.</p>
